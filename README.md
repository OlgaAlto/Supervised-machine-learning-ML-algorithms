# Supervised-machine-learning-ML-algorithms

Main idea: predicting whether patient`s biomechanical features are "normal" or "abnormal". 

To implement this idea was used the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.

Using open data I will see how KNN can be implemented with Python's Scikit-Learn library.
